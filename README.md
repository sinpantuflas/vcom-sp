# Voice-change-o-matic -sp
A version of MDN's Web Audio API-powered [voice changer and visualizer](https://github.com/mdn/voice-change-o-matic)  with dial knobs for changing node parameters.

An analyser node has been added to the input in order to have two probes at the input and output of the processing chain.

A simple peak frequency detector has been attached to the new analyser nodes.
